goals for lect
--------------

* change what programmers talk about to focus on stuff that's more high-value (say what you want; don't imply it imperfectly and request it indirectly)

* increase the semantic density 2x

* remove need to test or comment about stuff that's mechanical (stop checking for stupid gotchas)

* unify functional and procedural programming

* dramatically improve security and parallelism
